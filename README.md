# Hi there, I'm krake747 👋

## Welcome to my profile

I started in finance, automating spreadsheets with Python, and transitioned into software. Today I build full-stack web apps with a small team, exploring new tech while still enjoying conversations about finance and strategy. ([kevinkraemer.com](https://www.kevinkraemer.com/))

- 🌱 I help build full-stack systems with .NET, C#, and Go
- ⚛️ I build modern UIs with React and TanStack
- ⚙️ I love developing with Docker and want to get better at managing Kubernetes
- 🤔 I am curious about SolidJS, Gleam, and making design choices that don’t annoy users
- 🎯 I ship early, iterate fast, and learn constantly
- 🚴 I enjoy road and gravel cycling (and the occasional competitive itch)
